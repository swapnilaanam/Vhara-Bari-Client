Vhara Bari is a house/property rental website that allows house owners to upload their houses for rental on our website and tenants to rent those houses.

**Features:**

* Tenants on the website can find rental houses using the search by city name feature or the rental houses page. There is also an agent feature available for tenants who are having difficulty finding their desired houses. They can book houses using an online card payment system(stripe).

* House owners have a separate dashboard from where they can see important stats about their house. They can add their house for rental and from my houses page they can edit or remove that house from the website.
